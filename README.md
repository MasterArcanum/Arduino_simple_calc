Simple Arduino Calculator Project
This Arduino project is designed to create a basic calculator using an Arduino board. The code enables the Arduino to perform simple arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

<h2>How to use</h2>
Upload the .ino file to your Arduino board. Make sure that the keypad and LCD screen are correctly wired to the Arduino. Once uploaded, the calculator will be ready to use. Enter numbers and select operations using the keypad.
<h2>Hardware Requirements</h2>
- Arduino compatible board
- 4x4 Keypad
- LCD display compatible with the Hitachi HD44780 driver
- Connecting wires
<h2>Required Libraries</h2>
- Keypad.h
- LiquidCrystal.h
These libraries can be installed through the Arduino IDE Library Manager.
<h2>Example Usage</h2>
After uploading the sketch, use the keypad to enter numbers and operations. The LCD display will show the numbers entered and the results of the calculations. The calculator handles basic arithmetic operations and displays results in real-time.
